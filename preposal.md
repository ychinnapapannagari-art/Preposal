# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?



At Temple, I am apart of the student-managed investment fund known as the Owl Fund. One of the things that we are challenged with doing is creating hundreds of graphs a year that really, mostly, look the same and are required to follow the same formatting. I want to create an excel macro that is able to take a given set of data and create 4-6 different graphs according to the users command, wishes, and formatting guidelines. Given that each graph takes ~5-7 minutes to make, I hope to bring this time down to ~1-2 minutes per graph, while learning more about VBA coding in order to speed processes up in the future. As someone who is a business major, we spend a lot of time in excel, so I want this project to be something that I will be able to use in the future. (Yes, I know, it is a bit boring! However, it will help me immensely!)
