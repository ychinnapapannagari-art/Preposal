# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Graphs in an Instant!

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will create perfectly formatted graphs according to set criteria.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The code will be able to take a certain set of information, and then use that information to create a set of graphs according to a set listed criteria. Essentially, in my investment fund, we have graph book that we use to create a myriad of different graphs for use in presentations, investment reports, etc. My goal is to be able to learn VBA in the process, to help me automate future processes, and take the time to make each graph go from 4-5 minutes per graph to 1-2 minutes. In turn, this would save dozens of hours for members in my investment fund every year. Essentially, the user will input a set of data (usually from a publicly-listed website like FactSet or Bloomberg Terminal), then they will choose a specific type of graph (donut chart, bar chart, bar chart with growth rate, scatterplot w/ line of best fit + r^2 correlation, price target projection graph), and the code will be ran and will output the graph with perfect formatting according to my investment fund's standards. Hopefully, I will be able to create to use a drop-down menu to toggle between the different graphs in excel and the code will be able to use the toggle's output to create whatever graph the user selects. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, my final project will be able to take data from a one year or two year time frame and create at least one of the above graphs (donut, bar, bar w/ growth rate,  scatterplot, price target projection graph) and be able to consistently create reliable outputs.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In a better outcome, I will be able to make 2-3 of the above graphs that will maintain the same perfect formatting and reliable output criteria.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In the best outcome, I will be able to create 4+ graphs that maintain the same perfect formatting and reliable output criteria.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Well first, I need to learn VBA. Thinking about this logically in terms of code here are the steps I would have to follow:

1.If/Then Statements (to help with the toggles)

2.how to use the code to create a graph, 

3.how to associate the given data with the graph; how to title the axis

4.how to incorporate the given color codes into the given graphically representation

5.how to make everything the right shape and size 

6.how to make a line dotted

7.(optional?).how to allow the user to make multiple graphs on the same file 

8.Bug fixing/making sure the data is as expected, or how to reconcile any minor differences in data that could effect output
